Webpage link scraper / automatic link tester

This is a wonderful python scraper that searches html documents/webpages for <a> tags and then call the links.

I supports both REST API document retrieval and simple webpage retrievals.

After all links on the provided html document are called a summary will made and a list of malfunctioning links will be sent 
out to the specified receiver a full log will be printed out in the the terminal.
